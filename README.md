## Installation
1. Open terminal and type: `./scripts/clean.sh or sh scripts/clean.sh`.
2. Notes: 
- You may encounter the error, "zsh: permission denied: ./scripts/clean.sh". This error occurs when the user doesn't have the privileges to make edits to a file. 
- The permissions can be changed using the `chmod` keyword. The syntax for the command is: `chmod +x ./scripts/clean.sh`.
